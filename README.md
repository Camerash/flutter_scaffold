This is a scaffold project, designed to kickstart Flutter mobile app development.

Supports two platforms:
- iOS
- Android

Initially generated by the [Very Good CLI](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli) 🤖

Heavily modified to accostomed to personal practice 👨🏻‍💻

## What to expect 🤔

This project provides:
- Multi-flavor app for both iOS and Android
- API client generation according to endpoints
- JWT Token support
- State management with BLoC
- Localization (i18n)
- App icon generation
- App splash screen generation
- Navigation dependent on Auth state changes
- Provided LoginPage and HomePage that are ready to be used

Minimum Targeting Versions:
- Android: 21
- iOS: 12.0

Thoughtout the projects, there are multiple `TODO`s to guide you through stuff that requires manual configurations.

Also, for iOS specific settings, there are some steps that requires you to perform in XCode for best compatibility:
- Update bundle identifiers under each configurations
- Update `$(FLAVOR_APP_NAME)` under "Build Settings"

---

## Getting Started 🚀

This project contains 2 flavors:

- dev
- prod

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode or use the following commands:

```sh
# Dev
$ flutter run --flavor dev --target lib/main_dev.dart

# Prod
$ flutter run --flavor prod --target lib/main_prod.dart
```

## Updating App Icons 🖼

This project uses [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) to facilitate generation of app icons.

To update app icons:

1. Edit `flutter_icons` configurations under `pubspec.yaml` and update icon files under `assets/icons`
2. Run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

---

## Updating Native Splash Screen 🎨

This project uses [flutter_native_splash](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash) to facilitate generation of native splash screens.

To update app icons:

1. Edit `flutter_native_splash.yaml` for splash screen configurations and update icon files under `assets/icons`
2. Run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

---

## Working with Translations 🌐

This project relies on [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) for localizations.

Presumably, you should manage translations within the app with other stakeholders via a spreadsheet, with string for each row, and locale for each column.

After that:

1. Generate a `.csv` file and update `lib/i18n/translations.i18n.csv`
2. Run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run slang
```

You can update configuration of slang under `slang.yaml`

---

## Routing between screens 🚦

This project relies on [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route) for routing control and navigation with parameters.

1. Define your routes in `lib/core/navigation/app_router.dart`
2. Run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run build_runner build
```

---

## Generating data classes 🔣

This project recommends the usage of [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for generating consistent data-classes that support union, cloning equality and much more.

After defining your `Freezed` class, run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run build_runner build
```

---

## HTTP and API 📡

This projects uses [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) as the http client, and [Retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) for API route handling and generation.

Again, after defining your API routes under `lib/core/api`, run:

```sh
$ flutter pub run build_runner build
```
